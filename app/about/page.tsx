            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Hi, I'm Shashank Lahoti, a high school student and a beginner quizbowler. I created QbBookReview because I noticed the extremely steep learning curve that comes with picking up quizbowl. When I first began quizbowl, I was completely clueless. It took me nearly four months to even begin answering questions correctly. This experience was challenging, and I realized that many other beginners likely face the same struggles.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            I created QbBookReview to help others who are in my position. The goal of this website is to make the transition into quizbowl smoother and more accessible. Here, you can find a wide array of books that are essential for quizbowl preparation, create personalized reading lists, and review books to share insights with the community.
